These are just some dumb scripts that I use to put in place some
restrictions during school hours, namely:

* kill firefox and minecraft if they are running
* disable minecraft-launcher
* replace /etc/hosts with a file that has restrictions

There's also a script to run after school hours to lift
the restrictions.

To install, run the `install.sh` script.  It needs root access, so run
with sudo or in a root shell.

This is all designed to run on Ubuntu, but should be reasonably portable
to other Unix flavors.  It's very custom to the situation we have, but
it might not be too hard to adapt for something slightly different.
